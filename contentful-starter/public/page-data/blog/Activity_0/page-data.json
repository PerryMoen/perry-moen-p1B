This was nice becasue we were able to make sure that our code looked exctly like the teachers code, and then save. </p>\n<p>  I totally can appreciate that the idea is to get the general concept of what was happening with gatsby - and take away the learning principles to apply later. </p>\n<p>  We have a project that we were to do - and basically it was to choose a project and make it using the technologies covered in class. So that being said, I decided to re-do the assignments leading up to the project, but parallel them using a different boiler plate on gatsby, and blog about the journey as I complete each lesson. </p>\n<p>  I figured that this would allow me to try to get abstracts of the lessons being tought rather than directly copying and pasting, or painstakingly reviewing code line by line for the missing syntax errors!</p>\n<p>  So for this project I chose the gatsby-starter-blog within the \"Starters\" section of gatsby.</p>\n<p>  <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/0sj8grd9aquu/1KtaAFeqXQ4LZmTkg6Auf5/539ac8b1f5966d80d03665b8f35d2f39/gatsby-starter-blog.png\" alt=\"Gatsby Starter Blog Image\"></p>\n<p>  So like previous projects, we start by making a git repo, and then start running command line magic to get our projects up and running. ran the code given in the starter kit: </p>\n<pre><code>  gatsby new gatsby-starter-blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog\n</code></pre>\n<p>  I did a little poking around once the code was done running, and looked at alot of the files that had been created, noted that it had a componets folder, and pages, and a template. </p>\n<p>  In the pages folder, I don't see index.js like I'm expecting, I see an Index.tsx. I should do a little research on what that is, but for the moment we'll call that technical debt that will have to be paid later down the road. </p>\n<p>  When it came time to compile the code, I had several issues, it kept thinking that I had more than one graphql query in a single .js file.. which by default we now have learned that you can only have one graphql per file, that's cool.. I'm wondering if it has something to do with the fact it shoves all the info it gets from the query into the data variable and you can only have one data variable at a time. </p>\n<p>  When reviewing the boilerplate files, there was only one graphql - then I found a very obscure thread online, that stated that for windows, to check that the console drive was C (upper case) vs c, lowercase. That meant that I would need ot now figure out how to see my current working directory. Lead me to learning about the command line pwd. (print working directory).</p>\n<p>Sure enough I was in a lower case c situation, just cd'd into the proper directory being carefule to do upper case C this time. Then ... I got a series of other errors, that I could not decipher. The browser was telling me that there was a mistake likely with gatsby and to start a ticket. I went to the github repo, and saw that others had a similar experiece. The solution was to do:</p>\n<pre><code>npm install gatsby\nnpm install gatsby-cli\n</code></pre>\n<p>  I would have thought that these two things would have been taken care of when i ran the starter code previously, but it is possible I was working with an outdated library set, or maybe the starter kit was working with deprecated libraries. Not sure, eitherway, however, that did the trick and the website was up and running on the localhost:8000 :)</p>\n<p>  The next activity - looks like we're going to be digging into the graphql a bit, and adding some of our own pages.</p>"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"Activity_0"}}}
