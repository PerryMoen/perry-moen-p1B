Basically I started a project using one of the Gatsby starter projects. I was going to take that project and sort of follow along with assignments given to us by an instructor. The assignment started off with a different starter, and show us how to integrate various aspects of web development. I really want to take the concepts taught and apply them to a new starter, and try to replicate the concepts with a different starter. </p>\n<p>I got pretty far with my idea, but eventually I hit roadblocks that I wasn't sure how to rectify. I would say overall it was really an enjoyable experience in troubleshooting these things, with lots of frustration if you can believe it. I learned a lot through reading documentation in this process, and while I was trying to troubleshoot I ran across a starter kit that was made just for contentful. </p>\n<p>So here I am I have created a new project and I have decided to use this particular starter. I would just like to say that having done this assignment from scratch one time already, and then also failing with my second attempt, this starter was incredibly easy to use.</p>\n<p>You basically install the starter, then you do NPM run and answer all the questions. From there it sets up your entire project, hides your keys in.EMV files, hooks up your server, makes your template.JS, updates your config file, everything you need is just done!</p>\n<p>I was really excited about this, and so I went and started adding extra blog posts to content. That I could import them. I decided that I did not want the default starter blog posts, so I deleted them. Then all of a sudden my app crashed. I could not figure out what was going on, it seemed that I needed to have the default starter kits enabled in order to do anything. That didn't seem right.</p>\n<p>It took me a long time but I finally figured out what was causing it to crash! The graphicql requires a field called tag to be filled out in your blog post. The default posts had tags, but my posts did not have tags. I went and added tags to one of my posts and suddenly everything ran. So it looks like all you need is just one blog post I have a tag and you are golden.</p>\n<p>I also spent about 45 minutes trying to figure out how to edit my profile picture and profile data. I was looking in every single file, every single HTML, nothing I could find showed any mapping to a profile picture, or description of the author that I was seeing on the local post webpage I finally figured out, it was actually a person profile in contentful, the headless EMS allows you to update a person profile, which I thought was really interesting concept! Totally makes sense, have all of your information for the blog in the CMS, including information about the author.</p>\n<p>I think overall having struggled through the assignment the first time, and then having the failure of the second time around, made me really appreciate the work that was put into making this particular starter with Gatsby successful.</p>"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"activity-3-lessons-learned"}}}
