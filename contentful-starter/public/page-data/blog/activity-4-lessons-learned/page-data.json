It seems like this exercise I was able to crank through things, and even some on the spot troubleshooting was required!</p>\n<p>Activity four called for us to implement styled components, I didn't get too crazy with the actual implementation, I definitely see the usefulness of it and is a really neat tool to have in your toolbelt.</p>\n<p>Personally I still like having a separate CSS file, still think it gets a little too complicated when you start importing styled components. But I do like how easily you can make different style components without having to adjust your CSS files.</p>\n<p>I implemented a H3 and a P style in My heroes.JS file.</p>\n<h2>Trouble shot like a boss...</h2>\n<p>As I was rounding out the previous activity, the command line and let me know that I was not running the most current version of Gatsby, and that I should upgrade. So, I did just that and installed the most updated version of Gatsby.</p>\n<p>When I finished my implementation of the styled components and went to spin up the server, I got an error that the detect port package was nowhere to be found. I did a quick Google search and found that just a few hours ago at the time of me writing this blog somebody else had made an issue on get hub with Gatsby identifying that since the upgrade they also were having an issue.</p>\n<p>And so as I was quickly scrolling through the comments, somebody had just moments before updated that you needed to manually install the detect-port package. I quickly did this then tried to Gatsby Develop once again, and my code finally compiled!</p>\n<p>I know something like this might seem very small and trivial, but I did feel like the first time I was able to navigate, read, and understand the solutions to the problems I was running against. I did not feel like I was blindly executing a solution not understanding the fundamentals behind the process.</p>\n<p>Now let's not get crazy I have no idea what the package detect-port does, and I'm sure somebody way smarter than me wrote it so that I wouldn't have to have an idea. Time will tell on that one! But the endgame is I am starting to feel more comfortable navigating my way around troubleshooting. This was a really good experience!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/24325\">Here's a link to the issue that shows the solution.</a></p>"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"activity-4-lessons-learned"}}}
